# AI Model for Predicting World Cup Matches
Overview:
This project is designed to predict the outcomes of World Cup matches using an AI model. It combines web scraping and machine learning to gather data and make predictions on match results.

# Features
* **Web Scraping:** Data Extraction - utilizes the requests library to fetch HTML content from FBref's web pages, and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract relevant data. This includes player</br> statistics, match results, and other performance metrics.
Comprehensive Collection: Captures detailed information from thousands of players and matches, ensuring a robust dataset for analysis.
* **AI Model:** Data Handling - Processes the scraped data using pandas to create structured DataFrames. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming features to prepare</br> it for modeling.
Predictive Modeling - Employs the RandomForest algorithm to build a predictive model. The model is trained on historical match data to forecast future match outcomes, leveraging the patterns and insights derived from the dataset.
